## Response

Tina Hold says sex work is a public health crisis -- carrying condoms can be evidence as participating in sex work. This intrigued me, and I checked the laws of New York State. As of 2013, it is now illegal to use contraception as evidence for sex work.

And this is the updated and maintained legislation as of 2021.

One thing I find fascinating and sad is the amount of `Aye, with reservations`. *Four* legislators had RESERVATIONS about removing the use of contraception as evidence. Personally, I carry condoms and lube with me and I'm actively not a sex worker. What possible reservations could a legislator have other than being blatantly biased?
