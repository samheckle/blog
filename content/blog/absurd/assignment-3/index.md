## About a Pivot
Philip and my original idea was explicitly around drinking, and specifically was designed to create a mutual drinking experience. 
[link to Philip's brainstorming post](https://cadoux-itp.notion.site/Fall-2021-Blog-2f87c6bb054f45f1aeebeb3dbcb873ca?p=06156af79a724b2fa10eff72523630da)

![here are our original prototypes, contrasting with another prototype we are somewhat basing our project on](./proto.png)

We ended up pivoting to::

    An adult nightlight that tells you a bar story to help you fall 
    asleep and dispenses a sleep-aid

![here is our ideation process](./sketch.png)

We are now curating a bar experience from the comfort of your own bed, so you can regale your friends with tales of your wild night without actually needing to leave your hotel room.
