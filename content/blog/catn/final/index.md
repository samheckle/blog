## inspiration
[first iteration](http://samheckle.com/blog/catn/assignment-4/)

## process

added new functionality: "retrace steps", 
```
Understand "retrace steps" as retracing. 
Retracing is an action applying to nothing. 
Check retracing:
    if the location is not Death, say "There are no footsteps to follow." instead;
Carry out retracing:
    try going inside;
```

## final
