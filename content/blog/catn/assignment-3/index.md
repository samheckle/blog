## Idea

Drawing inspiration from [Zen Garden](https://cephalopodunk.itch.io/zen-garden-portland), I wanted to create what it is like as a digital love letter. It is one sided, so the player must piece together the responses from the other person. 

## Game

This will be updated with more content because I would like to explore the idea more but I don't feel comfortable with my own pixel art ;-;
