## inspiration

initially i was inspired by my assignment 2 where i did a cut up of beatrice potter's written work. so, in a similar vein, i created a piece that combines this cut up with fridge poetry.

[my original cut up](https://github.com/samheckle/rwet/blob/master/assignment-2/assignment-2.ipynb)

what i also wanted to experiment with hosting on glitch and using it as a server to make REST api calls to.

## process

what i first did was make sure i could get the server working.
