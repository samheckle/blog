# Lab: Transistor and relay lab
[lab 1](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/using-a-transistor-to-control-high-current-loads-with-an-arduino/)

After setting up my pentiometer I realized that I do not have a DC power adaptor or a DC motor in my apartment. I tried using my servo motor which worked, but I believe we had done this in a previous class.

# Lab: Controlling a DC Motor with an H-Bridge
[lab 2](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/dc-motor-control-using-an-h-bridge/)

In this lab I was missing the H-bridge, DC motor, and the DC power adaptor. 

# Lab: Controlling a Stepper Motor With an H-Bridge
[lab 3](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/lab-controlling-a-stepper-motor-with-an-h-bridge/)

In this lab I was missing the H-bridge, stepper motor, and DC power adaptor.

# Alternative Research
I definitely went through the labs and watched the videos. I haven't heard of a stepper motor before, but it felt similar to using a rotary encoder. It was interesting seeing the breakdown of a stepper motor and how it is a series of magnets.
