## Project 3 Idea

For my third and final project I will continue work on my game controller etch-a-sketch from [project 2](http://samheckle.com/blog/physical-computing/project-2/). 

Goals for this upgraded version:
 
 - upgraded housing with etch-a-sketch using a circular dremel saw
 - modify the controller to look clean on the housing and solder wires
 - add second rotary encoder 
 - upgrade game with updated animations to combine with my animation classwork

 So far I have had so many issues trying to take apart this etch-a-sketch but I have plans to enlist some help and take it apart tomorrow (11/25) and fingers crossed that it goes well.

Possible resources:

This is actually ridiculous but it actually demonstrates that the red part is a simple housing, so if I can take apart the red housing I can sneak my wires and rotary encoders in that.

This one completely destroys the etch-a-sketch, so hopefully I will have better luck.
