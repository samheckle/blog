## Readings
# General Ecology: With Plants
# Idea of Intelligence

- mysticism, weirdness, and women becoming plants
- interacting with other lifeforms is taught out of us
- *intelligence is anthropormorphized*
- everything underwater lives in a world of sound and vibrations
- intelligence is a tool to resonate familiarity, an aspect of life
- plant thinking is not plant intelligence

still more likely to prescribe intelligence to voice assistants such as alexa and google home

# Multispecies Worldbuilding Lab

- botany might have potential as a place of resistance and art pedagogy
- "eco-queer" way of living
- weed is "invasion" of suburban living
- invasion
    - weed is queerness
