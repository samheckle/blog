Focusing on environmental awareness and the feasibility of using bacterial cellulose as a material for a product I use often -- I think it would be so interesting to play with the concept of creating a game console completely from reusuable parts. Initially I had more broadly defined thoughts such as computers or other predominant technology, but if there is one person I admire from childhood it would be David Cronenberg.

Despite my distaste for VR in general, I think there is some respite in escapism. This isn't necessarily always a good thing, however, but the Black Mirror episode *San Junipero* discusses an afterlife where people can exist in a virtual space beyond death. If we can create a definitive virtual space using biomaterials, would that not be similar to a natural burial? Obviously this seems out of the picture now, but as we see natural burials being more and more prevlant (a natural burial does not include any chemical elements in the process, so no embalming and no coffin but wrapped in cloth), it seems fitting that we could find a solution that would be able to recreate the afterlife in the future.

What I would imagine is both a physical console and some sort of virus or bacterium that would be injected into a person immediately post-mortem. Similar to the way the current existing embalming process happens now. Then after the virus spread its way through the body, the virus would transfer to the phsyical console. This effectively is a copied "soul" of the person that will continue to exist in the bacterium.

Some considerations:
* Power -- At this moment I don't know how the console would be powered. Would it subsist on itself until the end of time? Would the "soul" be able to persist or is there a second death?
* Storage -- Who maintains the storage of the console?
